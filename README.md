Using Deep Learning to Clone Driving Behavior
---------------------------------------------

NOTE: This project builds on a lot of work done in https://github.com/emef/sdc except for
using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network instead of a 2D Convolutional Neural Network + LSTM.

Step 0: Infrastructure Setup

Step 1: Model design

Step 2: Training on the sample data provided

Step 3: Collecting data

Step 4: Overfitting the collected data to solve Track 1

Step 5: Solving Track2 in isolation

Step 6: Back to solving Track1 in isolation

Data collection methods:
